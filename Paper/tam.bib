title="Strict Self-Assembly of Fractals Using Multiple Hands",
journal="Algorithmica",
year="2015",
pages="1--30",
abstract="In this paper we consider the problem of the strict self-assembly of infinite fractals within tile self-assembly. In particular, we provide tile assembly algorithms for the assembly of a Sierpinski triangle and the discrete Sierpinski carpet within a class of models we term the h-handed assembly model (h-HAM), which generalizes the 2-HAM to allow up to h assemblies to combine in a single assembly step. Despite substantial consideration, no purely growth self-assembly model has yet been shown to strictly assemble an infinite fractal without significant modification to the fractal shape. In this paper we not only achieve this, but in the case of the Sierpinski carpet are able to achieve it within the 2-HAM, one of the most well studied tile assembly models in the literature. Our specific results are as follows: We provide a 6-HAM construction for a Sierpinski triangle that works at scale factor 1, 30 tile types, and assembles the fractal in a near perfect way in which all intermediate assemblies are finite-sized iterations of the recursive fractal. We further assemble a Sierpinski triangle within the 3-HAM at scale factor 3 and 990 tile types. For the Sierpinski carpet, we present a 2-HAM result that works at scale factor 3 and uses 1216 tile types. We further include analysis showing that the aTAM is incapable of strictly assembling the Sierpinski triangle considered in this paper, and that multiple hands are needed for the near-perfect assembly of a Sierpinski triangle and the Sierpinski carpet.",

We show that the addition of duples allows for powerful behaviors of self-assembling systems at temperature 1, meaning systems which exclude the requirement of cooperative binding by tiles (i.e., the requirement that a tile must be able to bind to at least 2 tiles in an existing assembly if it is to attach). Cooperative binding is conjectured to be required in the standard aTAM for Turing universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes, but we show that in the DaTAM these behaviors can in fact be exhibited at temperature 1. We then give a lower bound on the tile complexity for building thin rectangles in the DaTAM that matches the analogous lower bound in the aTAM. Finally, we present a series of results which prove that the temperature-2 aTAM and temperature-1 DaTAM have mutually exclusive powers. That is, each is able to self-assemble shapes that the other can't, and each has systems which cannot be simulated by the other. Beyond being of purely theoretical interest, these results have practical motivation as duples have already proven to be useful in laboratory implementations of DNA-based tiles. "

abstract={From ligand-receptor binding to DNA hybridization, molecular recognition plays a central role in biology. Over the past several decades, chemists have successfully reproduced the exquisite specificity of biomolecular interactions. However, engineering multiple specific interactions in synthetic systems remains difficult. DNA retains its position as the best medium with which to create orthogonal, isoenergetic interactions, based on the complementarity of Watson-Crick binding. Here we show that DNA can be used to create diverse bonds using an entirely different principle: the geometric arrangement of blunt-end stacking interactions. We show that both binary codes and shape complementarity can serve as a basis for such stacking bonds, and explore their specificity, thermodynamics and binding rules. Orthogonal stacking bonds were used to connect five distinct DNA origami. This work, which demonstrates how a single attractive interaction can be developed to create diverse bonds, may guide strategies for molecular recognition in systems beyond DNA nanostructures. }

@article{Gillespie07,
    abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics describes the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system in a way that takes into account the fact that molecules come in whole numbers and exhibit some degree of randomness in their dynamical behavior. Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},
